We will visit a series of coastal archaeological sites in Nuu-chah-nulth territory in Barkley Sound and examine archaeological and ecological data from these sites in the lab. The majority of our time will be spent at the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre campus in the Treaty lands and traditional territory of the Huu-ay-aht First Nations. Our coursework will be research intensive and focus on archaeological data previously collected from various sites in Barkley Sound including the Broken Group islands in the traditional territory of the neighboring Tseshaht First Nation. Students will attend regular fieldtrips, labs, seminars, and lectures introducing them to Indigenous history and the and ~ analytical potential of ecological data obtained from archaeological sites. Assignments will involve reading annotations, field based mapping, artifact analysis, laboratory techniques, digitization of maps and profiles, and of zooarchaeological analysis (examination of animal remains from archaeological sites). During the last week of the course, students will conduct independent student research project reports. These reports will be edited and presented to the Huu-ay-aht, Tseshaht First Nations, the Bamfield Marine Science Centre as well as (BC Archaeology Branch and Parks Canada) upon completion of the course.Research Skills: Students will learn some fundamentals of archaeological documentation, including sampling, zooarchaeology, quantitative data analysis, and how to prepare written reports on their findings. We will work cooperatively in groups to develop and address research questions and regularly share our observations with community members.Boat Use: You will be given the opportunity to drive boats if you choose to do so. Boat driving is recommended but not required for Historical Ecology and Coastal Archaeology. Students who wish to drive boats at BMSC must hold a PCOC and valid first aid certificate and will participate in an introductory boat check-out on the first day of orientation.Prerequisite: For undergraduate credit, an introductory course in Archaeology or permission of the Instructor. For graduate credit, acceptance in an MA, MSc or PhD program in biology or anthropology or by application.Physical requirements: Students must be comfortable in boats and with traversing rough, slippery, and forested terrain in all weather. They must also be able to lift, carry, and/or operate equipment weighing up to 20 lbs.Required Text: McMillan, Alan D. and Iain McKechnie (editors) 2015 These Outer Shores: Archaeological Insights into Indigenous Lifeways along the Exposed Coasts of British Columbia.

The course will introduce students to frameworks such as; the formal and conceptual characteristics of objects (what \u0018shape\u0019 do they take and why at what particular time), the physical/cultural contexts in which these objects are placed (why does place matter?), some embodied practices such as walking (which lands are we on?). Western modern art history defined sculpture as a discipline whereby autonomous objects simply took up space in a gallery, building, or square. But contemporary sculptural practices have challenged this narrow view of art and there are a range of processes and ideas around m and ~aking and intervening in spaces, to inducing experiences and social relations.  The course is composed of lectures, readings  and  group discussions, studio work time (touching on ceramics, assemblage, mixed media, spatial interventions), and informal critiques.","subject_code":"EDCP","course_number":"400B","section_number":"951","building":"Neville Scarfe","room":"1105","instructors":["BERARD, MARIE-FRANCE"],"totalRemaining":"0","currentlyRegistered":"21","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Pass/Fail."},"441B":{"course_name":"EDCP 441B","subject_code":"EDCP","course_number":"441B","course_title":"Assessment in Mathematics Education - ASSMNT MATH EDUC","course_link":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=EDCP&course=441B&sessyr=2020&sesscd=S","sections":{"951":{"status":" ","section":"EDCP 441B 951","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=EDCP&course=441B&section=951&sessyr=2020&sesscd=S","activity":"Lecture","term":"2","interval":"","days":" Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri","start":"13:00","end":"15:00","comments":"","subject_code":"EDCP","course_number":"441B","section_number":"951","building":"Neville Scarfe","room":"1211","instructors":["LI, KEVIN"],"totalRemaining":"30","currentlyRegistered":"6","generalRemaining":"10","restrictedRemaining":"20"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":" "},"467D":{"course_name":"EDCP 467D","subject_code":"EDCP","course_number":"467D","course_title":"Special Topics in Curriculum and Pedagogy - SP TPCS C&P","course_link":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=EDCP&course=467D&sessyr=2020&sesscd=S","sections":{"96A":{"status":"Restricted","section":"EDCP 467D 96A","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=EDCP&course=467D&section=96A&sessyr=2020&sesscd=S","activity":"Lecture-Seminar","term":"2","interval":"","days":" ","start":"","end":"","comments":"2020 Summer Institute - Practical Foods.

The story of Indigenous visual expression arcs from before contact through to the present, so we begin with looking at the history of display practices and their impact on our understandings of art and material culture, of representation, misrepresentation, and selfrepresentation (Lonetree, 2012; Ki-Ke-In, 2013) . We will examine art making as auto-pedagogical, in that Indigenous makers learn as they go, about themselves, their own culture, and their relationship with the world (Anthes, 2015; Nicolson, 20 and ~13). For the rest of us, Indigenous visua and ~ l expression provides a pedagogy as we learn to view art as text, and employ a process of phenomenological inquiry that provokes dialogue leading to better understanding (Leddy, 2014). Throughout the entirety of our examination of this topic, we will be working towards developing decolonial literacies that will support ourselves as teachers as we support our students in their learning.","subject_code":"EDCP","course_number":"585C","section_number":"951","building":"No Scheduled Meeting","room":"","instructors":["TBA"],"totalRemaining":"0","currentlyRegistered":"20","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":" "},"585D":{"course_name":"EDCP 585D","subject_code":"EDCP","course_number":"585D","course_title":"Special Course in Curriculum and Pedagogy - SPECIAL CURR&PED","course_link":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=EDCP&course=585D&sessyr=2020&sesscd=S","sections":{"951":{"status":" ","section":"EDCP 585D 951","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=EDCP&course=585D&section=951&sessyr=2020&sesscd=S","activity":"Seminar","term":"2","interval":"","days":" Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri","start":"8:30","end":"17:30","comments":"","subject_code":"EDCP","course_number":"585D","section_number":"951","building":"Neville Scarfe","room":"1130","instructors":["PETHERICK, LEANNE"],"totalRemaining":"3","currentlyRegistered":"7","generalRemaining":"3","restrictedRemaining":"0"},"96A":{"status":"Blocked","section":"EDCP 585D 96A","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=EDCP&course=585D&section=96A&sessyr=2020&sesscd=S","activity":"Seminar","term":"2","interval":"","days":" Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri","start":"8:30","end":"17:30","comments":"This is a PDCE administered course for HOP2 cohort.

face a number of complex and seemingly intractable problems including such things as climate change, food security, global poverty and pandemic diseases. Understanding how to address such problems is the first step to solving them. Ultimately, we need to foster social and ecological resilience. Resilience is the ability of a linked social and ecological system to respond to stress and build the adaptive capacity of individuals and groups to respond to stress. This course provides an opportunity to learn and apply the conceptual tools of systems thinking and complexity theories for fostering social change and building adaptive capacity through application to cases on Haida Gwaii. Students are provided with an introduction to the conceptual to and ~ols of systems thinking, complexity and resilience that help understand the dynamics of social-ecological change and social innovation. The course will also involve additional local, community educators from Haida Gwaii and will incorporate local knowledge and local case examples to help elucidate and ground systems-based and complexity concepts.","subject_code":"HGSE","course_number":"320A","section_number":"621","building":"No Scheduled Meeting","room":"","instructors":["KOZAK, ROBERT ANTAL"],"totalRemaining":"18","currentlyRegistered":"2","generalRemaining":"18","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":"This course will be offered, as opportunities arise, by scientists visiting the Haida Gwaii Higher Education Society.

This course will make specific references to cases on Haida Gwaii and will involved additional local, community educators from Haida Gwaii. We will explore processes and techniques for incorporating environmental considerations in planning and evaluating proposals for future undertakings that may have significant social and ecological effects. The course provides an overview of the methodologies for the design and conduct of environmental impact studies that adhere to the Crown\u0019s legal and constitutional obligations to Indigenous People\u0019s. The main objective of this course is to introduce students to environ and ~mental assessment, with a focus on the origins, purposes, processes and gradual evolution of EA toward a sustainability-oriented framework, with particular reference to the Canadian federal environmental assessment regime.

Think about the course as if it is an upper-level history course, with classtime and research papers.)* specifies the number of credits (3 for one term, 6 for the full year, which would obviously require twice the work)* describes how your work will be evaluated (graded)* names the supervisor, and explains what kind of supervision s/he will provideGet the supervisor to sign the proposal so that I know s/he is willing to work with you, and that s/he agrees to evaluate you as the proposal states.","subject_code":"MUSC","course_number":"402C","section_number":"941","building":"No Scheduled Meeting","room":"","instructors":["TBA"],"totalRemaining":"10","currentlyRegistered":"0","generalRemaining":"10","restrictedRemaining":"0"},"002":{"status":"Unreleased","section":"MUSC 402C 002","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=MUSC&course=402C&section=002&sessyr=2020&sesscd=S","activity":"Directed Studies","term":"1-2","interval":"","days":" ","start":" ","end":" ","comments":"","subject_code":"MUSC","course_number":"402C","section_number":"002","building":"No Scheduled Meeting","room":"","instructors":["HERMISTON, NANCY JANE"],"totalRemaining":"0","currentlyRegistered":"0","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 6","description":"For fourth-year students who receive permission of the Director of the School of Music to do advanced studies in their major field."},"512E":{"course_name":"MUSC 512E","subject_code":"MUSC","course_number":"512E","course_title":"Directed Individual Studies - DOCT THESIS PREP","course_link":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=MUSC&course=512E&sessyr=2020&sesscd=S","sections":{"941":{"status":"Restricted","section":"MUSC 512E 941","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=MUSC&course=512E&section=941&sessyr=2020&sesscd=S","activity":"Tutorial","term":"1-2","interval":"","days":" ","start":" ","end":" ","comments":"","subject_code":"MUSC","course_number":"512E","section_number":"941","building":"No Scheduled Meeting","room":"","instructors":["TBA"],"totalRemaining":"27","currentlyRegistered":"3","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"27"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Approval by the Director, School of Music, is required."},"549A":{"course_name":"MUSC 549A","subject_code":"MUSC","course_number":"549A","course_title":"Master's Thesis - MASTERS THESIS","course_link":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=MUSC&course=549A&sessyr=2020&sesscd=S","sections":{"941":{"status":" ","section":"MUSC 549A 941","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=MUSC&course=549A&section=941&sessyr=2020&sesscd=S","activity":"Thesis","term":"1-2","interval":"","days":" ","start":" ","end":" ","comments":"","subject_code":"MUSC","course_number":"549A","section_number":"941","building":"No Scheduled Meeting","room":"","instructors":["TBA"],"totalRemaining":"38","currentlyRegistered":"5","generalRemaining":"38","restrictedRemaining":"0"},"942":{"status":"Unreleased","section":"MUSC 549A 942","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=MUSC&course=549A&section=942&sessyr=2020&sesscd=S","activity":"Thesis","term":"1-2","interval":"","days":" ","start":" ","end":" ","comments":"","subject_code":"MUSC","course_number":"549A","section_number":"942","building":"No Scheduled Meeting","room":"","instructors":["TBA"],"totalRemaining":"0","currentlyRegistered":"0","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"0"},"971":{"status":"Unreleased","section":"MUSC 549A 971","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=MUSC&course=549A&section=971&sessyr=2020&sesscd=S","activity":"Thesis","term":"2","interval":"","days":" ","start":" ","end":" ","comments":"","subject_code":"MUSC","course_number":"549A","section_number":"971","building":"No Scheduled Meeting","room":"","instructors":["TBA"],"totalRemaining":"0","currentlyRegistered":"0","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 6","description":" "}}},"NAME":{"code":"NAME","link":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-department&dept=NAME","title":"Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering","faculty":"Faculty of Applied Science","courses":{"592":{"course_name":"NAME 592","subject_code":"NAME","course_number":"592","course_title":"Shipbuilding Internship","course_link":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=NAME&course=592&sessyr=2020&sesscd=S","sections":{"921":{"status":"Blocked","section":"NAME 592 921","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=NAME&course=592&section=921&sessyr=2020&sesscd=S","activity":"Work Placement","term":"1-2","interval":"","days":" ","start":" ","end":" ","comments":"Registration is by permission only.

It is designed to equip the students with the tools and concepts needed to deal with both everyday and more technical arguments, as well as the skills to analyse, and resolve, everyday confusions, ambiguities, and fallacies. Topics covered include the distinction between logic and rhetoric; the analysis and resolution of ambiguities and fallacies; validity and inductive strength of arguments; elementary classical propositional and predicate logics; term, modal, multi-valued and relevance logics. Required Text: J. Woods, A. Irvine and D. Walton, Argument: Critical Thinking, Logic and the Fallacies, 2nd ed., Pearson Canada, 2004.Evaluation: 10 online small group discussions (worth 10% of the final grade), 9 short online quizzes \u0013 one for each course module (40%), and an on-campus or remotely proctored computer-based final exam during the examination period (50%). Apart from the final exam, all the activities are totally online and do not require your physical presence on UBC Vancouver campus. In addition, an off-campus final exam may be arranged at many UBC partner exam centres worldwide (see http://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/courses-registration/distance-education/exam-off-campus).","subject_code":"PHIL","course_number":"120","section_number":"98A","building":"No Scheduled Meeting","room":"","instructors":["KOROLEV, ALEXANDRE"],"totalRemaining":"0","currentlyRegistered":"61","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Tools for dealing with both everyday and more technical arguments and concepts.

Students will work in groups to study cases of climate conflict (e.g., divestment, carbon taxes, pipelines, climate strikes, civil disobedience), analyse underlying individual and systemic sources of conflict, write and perform short Forum Theatre pieces  that welcome audience interventions, and reflect on the experience. Our learning goals are the capacity to analyze the systemic nature of climate conflicts, the development of reflexive processes that challenge our own assumptions and perspectives, and the acquisition of the basic skill necessary to construct an interactive theatrical model of a complex situation.  Along the way, students will re and ~flect on the potential role of the arts in the climate crisis.The course is open to upper-level students from any major. No prior courses in either political science or theatre are required. Students need not have written or performed in plays before.
